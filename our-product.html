    <p>Group3's SuperPres simplifies computing teaching by giving your students the power to create, without having to worry about complex setup and arcane Graphics libraries - and without having to use Domain Specific or Antiquated languages.</p>
    <p>Simply Launch Group3 SuperPres, click on <em>Start New</em>, and start creating visual, interactive, and engaging lessons, demos and projects.</p>

    <h3><em>The perfect next step from Scratch</em></h3>
      <p>SuperPres is designed to be the perfect stepping stone in-between Visual Programming such as Scratch and fully-fledged GUI tool-kits such as QT, and a perfect teaching aid for UK GCSE and A-Level courses.<br>
We find that block-coding programs work well for teaching basic logic but neglects actual coding skill and more complex logic, whereas most tutorials for C++ or Java skip the basics and can leave less experienced programmers staring at a blank screen, or leave them with just enough knowledge to be dangerous - but not to be useful.</p>
    <h3><em>Levelling Up Your Teaching</em></h3>
      <p>Our Platform allows your students to easily take their learning to the next level; without having to overcome the barrier of unfamilliar text interfaces, you can teach your students in more depth and leave them with practical transferable skills - after all, who likes making FizzBuzz anyway?</p>
    <h3><em>Projects? Yes Please!</em></h3>
      <p>SuperPres contains full Python and JavaScript engines, with all the base functionality you'd expect anywhere else - such as Networking, Threading, and pre-supplied constructs like Quicksort and Queues.<br>
      Combined with our multimedia interface, this makes Group3 SuperPres eminently suitable for your students to create interesting GCSE or A-Level projects.</p>
    <h3><em>Sshh! No talking in the Library!</em></h3>
      <p>If the builtin functionality of Group3 Superpres is not enough for your projects, simply import libraries from the Java Ecosystem and use them within your applications as you would with built-in functions.</p>
